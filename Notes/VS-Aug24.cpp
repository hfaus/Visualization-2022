/**
 * Three types of memory
 *  - Sensory : Pre-attentive processing
 *  - Short team : 
 *  - 
 * 
 * Gestalt Laws/Principles
 * - Gestalt : German word roughtly translated as form, pattern or configuration
 * - Humans perceive relationships/patterns
 * - Principles :
 *      - Proximity : immediately group objects closer together, assume relation
 *           * * * * * * *  vs ** ** ** ** **
 *              ex - scatterplot
 *      - Similarity : similar shape, size, color or texture, assume relation
 *              * * * $ $ $ & $ & & & &
 *      - Closure : we fill in the blanks, infer outline of shape
 *              ex - the WWF panda
 *      - Enclosure : enclose data in some way to show user its importance
 *              ex - circlue or shade a portion of data
 *      - Continuity : objects or shpae that are arranged in a line or a curve are perceived to be more related than those that are abrupt
 *              *
 *               *
 *                *
 *              * * * * * * * *
 *                  *
 *                   *
 *                    *
 *      - Figure-Ground : based on the color, contrast, size objects are separated as whole figures from their backgrounds
 *              ex - those photos where you can see a young or old woman
 * 
 * Short term memory
 * - Stays around for a min
 * - Can increase by use of chunking (grouping similar things together)
 * 
 * Change blindness
 * - Failure to notice a difference in successive images
 * - Take away : need to be very clear when presenting differences 
 *      ex - scientific graphs
 * 
 * Long term memory
 * - Not directly involved in visualization process, but still has an effect
 * 
 * Do not use red and green together, color blind people can't see
